### Howdy, friend!

My name is Ty Lavergne, and I am from the small town of Buna, Texas. Here's what's important to me:

- Above all, I am a follower of Christ. In all that I do, I aim to be faithful to Him. 🙌🏻
- Family is important to me. Without them, I would not be where I am today. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- I have the honor to attend the best University on the planet, Texas A&M. 👍🏻
